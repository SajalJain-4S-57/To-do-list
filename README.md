📝 To-Do List Web App

A simple and stylish To-Do List web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to add, mark, edit, and delete tasks, while showing progress visually with a dynamic progress bar. All data is saved locally using the browser's localStorage, so your tasks stay even after refreshing.
